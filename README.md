This project is a Pokedex, where a user lands on the homepage and is able to put in a Pokemon that they would like to search up. There is also an option for the user to get information about a random Pokemon, so if they click that button, they would be able to get that information. The information that is output is the name, the photo of the Pokemon, and the type. 

When the user puts in a Pokemon that doesn't exist, it will return a 403 error. If the user puts in nothing, it will also prompt a 403 error. All errors will have the user sent to a different page. This Pokedex populates all Pokemon that exist so far, and all information is taken from PokeAPI.
